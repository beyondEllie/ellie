}
```

## Code Example

Here's some inline `code` and a larger block:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from Python!")
    return "success"
```

### Nested Lists

1. First item
   - Nested item
   - Another nested item
2. Second item

     - Even deeper

> This is a blockquote that should be nicely formatted.
